				<p> The Ateneo Lady Eagles is the volleyball team that represents the Ateneo de Manila University in the UAAP women's volleyball
				games. Ateneo Lady Eagles were back to back champions in seasons 76 and 77 where they were the first team to go 16-0 in a season.
				They won in Shakey's V-League, a summer tournament which the Ateneo Lady Blue Eagles uses as a preparation for the UAAP tournament, 
				back in 2011. In the championship game, rookie Alyssa Valdez was seen as having delivered a key performance for Ateneo. Her coach 
				for this tournament, Charo Soriano, a former star Lady Blue Eagle herself, had this to say about the prized recruit: 
				"She really pulled it through for us".</p>
